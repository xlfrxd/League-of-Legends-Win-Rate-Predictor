# STINTSY-S18-Group1

## STINTSY Machine Project

**Section**: S18  
**Project Group**: 1  
**Members**: Ramirez Benmar, Jose Latosa, Alfred Victoria  

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the performance of teams in the **League of Legends 2021 Worlds Play-in Stage** using statistical and machine learning techniques. The dataset provides in-game metrics, team performances, and match results.

## Dataset
### `LOL2021WORLDS.csv`
This dataset contains statistics from the League of Legends 2021 Worlds Play-in Group stage, including:
- Team performance metrics (e.g., gold earned, kills, deaths, assists)
- Objective control (e.g., Baron, Dragon, Turrets)
- Match duration and game outcomes

## Jupyter Notebook
### `STINTSY-PROJECT-S18-GROUP1.ipynb`
This notebook performs:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and transforming data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing key statistics and trends.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Investigating factors affecting match outcomes.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predicting match results based on in-game statistics.

## Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Running the Notebook
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xlfrxd/League-of-Legends-Win-Rate-Predictor/
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd STINTSY-S18-Group1
```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook STINTSY-PROJECT-S18-GROUP1.ipynb
```

## Future Improvements
- Additional feature engineering to refine predictions.
- Incorporation of deep learning models for enhanced analysis.
- Extending analysis to other League of Legends tournaments.
